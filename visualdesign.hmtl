 <p> I use the program adobe express to describe my personal aesthetic. I started by
selecting pictures that represent my 6 word memoirs. I chose pictures that were yellow
and white because these colors assemble optimism, joy, creativity, lightness, purity
and individuality. My favorite color is purple but I think that yellow and white show my
characteristics more. I Included a person who was listening to music while watching the
sunset because I love listening to music and like watching the sunset. I think my collage
matches my aesthetic because as an individual it represents how calm, neat and
professional I can be. </p>





<h1> Pop Art </h1>

<p> The pop art using swatches was the most captivating to my attention. I changed the
colors for my subject face by making a palette. The tools I used were the pencil, bucket
paint, and swatches. The swatches are the colors that you use often. I chose Vanessa
Hudgens for my project because her personality seems so genuine and I love her work.
Vaneessa is an American actress and singer. She has been in various movies such as
high school musical, Bad boys for life, and Journey 2: The Mysterious Island.</p>


   
<h2> Pixel Character </h2>
<p> The idea when creating the pixel character was going for an adventure/ mysterious
theme. I used the tools by adding color that would complement what I was going for.
I started by creating the face and then the body. My character is a female with a tan
skin color. She is wearing a sky gray blue t-shirt with black/gray pants. My character
would be in a game that is mysterious but will have to complete different obstacle
course in order to achieve the game.</p>






<h1> Kaleidoscopes </h1>
<p> I made photo kaleidoscopes by using photoshop in adobe express. Some of the steps I took
were to select a photo that was of forest trees in the autumn. Next, I duplicated the layers a
couple of times. Then I created a horizontal mirror effect and merged down the layers. Lastly, the
result was completely different from the photo in the beginning. The outcome shows a variation of
patterns that is reflected.</p> 

         



<h1> Poverty </h1> 
 <img src="Screen Shot 2022-12-09 at 8.37.33 AM.png"  width="250" height="250" alt="Poverty"> 
<p> My social justice topic was poverty. I decided to speak about this particular topic because this is
a global issue that needs to be addressed. I feel like the public when hearing about poverty only
think about the financial sides of it but the truth is that there is more to that. Lack of job
opportunity can lead to not being able to provide financial support which sometimes leads to
mental health issues. I assembled my photos by using a mask layer and brush tool to get rid of
things that were important to the topic. I kept some words that identify the different issues that
lead to poverty.</p>
