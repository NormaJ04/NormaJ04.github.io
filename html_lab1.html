  <p> I am current student at Beca. Last year was my third year joing this program called CAP. </p>


<h1 > After Beca </h1>
  
  <p> After Beca, I want to get a job and go to college. 
    I still do not know what career I want to study. All I know is that I want to take bussiness classes.
    I believe that take this class is important no matter what your career because it help you in the near future whern creating a bussiness.
