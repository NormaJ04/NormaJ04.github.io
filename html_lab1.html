<h1> Before Beca   </h1>

  <p> Before Beca, I was going to a middle school near by here.  
    It is called Bronx Writing Academy. Those two years that I attend that school I made some great memories. 
    I still to this day have some connection with people who attend that school. The teachers that taught me 
   while I attend that school was a great support system for me and the people that attend that school.  </p>

 <h1> During Beca</h1>
 
  <p> I am current student at Beca. Last year was my third year joing this program called CAP. Cap was
  intership and hepled develop as students your job experince.  We had to about three position depending 
   on what had selected.  I have met some incredible teachers, staffs, and classmates.  I am glad that I 
   was able to be  apart of this school. I can stay that Beca has a community had accomplished there mission
   in getting us ready for college. I am going to be completely honest but junior year was a lot of pressure 
   for all oif because we recover for the pademic. </p>


<h1 > After Beca </h1>
  
  <p> After Beca, I want to get a job and go to college. 
    I still do not know what career I want to study. All I know is that I want to take bussiness classes.
    I believe that take this class is important no matter what your career because it help you in the near 
   future whern creating a bussiness. It is always ti be one step ahead of your carreer path.
