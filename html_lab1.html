 <h1> Before Beca   </h1>

  <p> Before Beca, I was going to a middle school near by here.  
    It is called Bronx Writing Academy. Those two yaears that I attend that school I made some great memories. 
    I still to this day have some connection with people who attend that school. The teachers that taught me 
   while  I attend that school was a great support system for me and the people that went to the school.  ]</p>

  intership and hepled develop as students your job experince.  We hadf to about three position depending 
   on what had selected. </p>


<h1 > After Beca </h1>
  
  <p> After Beca, I want to get a job and go to college. 
    I still do not know what career I want to study. All I know is that I want to take bussiness classes.
    I believe that take this class is important no matter what your career because it help you in the near 
   future whern creating a bussiness. It is always ti be one step ahead of your carreer path.
